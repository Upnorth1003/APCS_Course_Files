<+s>: Had to really think outside the box.

<-s>: I had some trouble remembering how to correlate letters with the alphabet
again but I think that I managed to do it well this time. Maybe not efficient but
well.

********************************************************************************

1) I ran into problems on how to correlate the letters coming up to the regular
alphabet. To resolve this problem I sat down and took a minute to write out
what needed to be done and a way to type and execute it.

2) Their frequencies didn't really correlate well together, sometimes I would
look at the percent and it was a who integer value off. Reading from files that
have more writing in them could make this process better.

3) They way I would go about doing this is pretty simple. We already made the
code for getting the frequencies of the two different passages. All we would
need to do next is write another method to compare both the frequencies, with
some room of about 5% error. Then when the program has a rough estimate, you
would write another method to switch out the letters compared in the frequencies.

DECODED MESSAGE:
first i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving
the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to the earth
