    As someone who lives in the Downriver area in Michigan, that is south of Detroit, I agree that we need to find better ways of sustainable energy besides burning fossil fuel. There are actions to take against companies that burn fuels that cause more green house gases, but companies are more willing to pay the fines than get the filters, or whatever they need, to reduce their emissions. I do agree with Ian; in the fact that, we are not bringing in renewable energy fast enough. Driving by southern Detroit you can see the impact the Marathon gas plant has, because all you see are run down houses that have smog all over them and people still live in the houses! It's just not safe. Computer modeling can help show what we are leading our selfs into. While not showing us the exact future. They give a good representation on what we are heading into if we do not change our actions. The computer models are giving us proof of how bad it might get, but most people won't do anything until it starts to directly effect them more than it is already.

    I do agree with you on the fact that we are not making the switch to renewable energy fast enough. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿People don't realize it because it has not started to directly affect them as much as it will in the future. I feel the government is doing something but it isn't big enough yet to start getting people to start to do something about it.

I think that solar and water are the most promising in Michigan considering that we are surrounded by lakes and have many, many rivers and canals in our state. I can see wind being an option too, but that can be expensive to build the big windmills. Whereas, the cost for solar panel creation is starting to go down and become more affordable to the middle class.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
﻿   I think that we are slightly seeing the implications now
