Q1: The programmer should get the credit for the piece of computer art.
The reason is because the programmer is the one who had written the code
that was executed to create the art made by the computer.

Plan: I would plan the code out so that it would pick random numbers and
those would be the starting point. Then lines would be drawn, if numbers are
negative then the lines get drawn horizontal. Then if numbers are positive the
lines get drawn vertical. Then random coordinates are generated and then the box
surrounding it get colored in and if the box is already colored it skips and
then trys again. It stops when certain conditions, like number of lines made and
boxes colored based on random numbers generated a certain amount of time.

PMR:
Not a usual PMR but the assignment is an interesting take to have to start
learning recursion. I had to really think about how I wanted the code to execute.
