<+s>: The project was fairly simple to make as the last one.The if else if
statements were not hard to grasp. But I was wondering if you are wanting us to
make booleans every time or if we were allowed to enter them in the () in the if
statement.

<-s>: As usual the only thing that I struggled with was the conversion math and
me trying to figure out if I needed to multiply or divide.
